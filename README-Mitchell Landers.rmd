##Brief biography of me, myself, and I

### My Beginnings

**Background**

When I was a young warthog (Timone in background: when he was a young waaarthooooog), I...

-was afraid of barbers but especially the sound of Daffy Duck
-switched schools often (my parents were picky)
-had two older siblings, both of whom were much older than I was
-loved disney movies
-loved basketball even more than disney movies

After high school, I attended UC Berkeley, where both my love of philosophy and existential anguish grew (correlation or causation? You decide!). From there, I returned home to the Motherland (Santa Barbara) and chanced upon discovering evolutionary psychology. Now I'm here at Chicago pursuing a Ph.d in psychology. The good news: my existential anguish has mostly subsided; the bad news: it was to be replaced by its homely nephew, general stress.
